## About

I am a licensed professional conselor and have been working in the mental health field for over 10 years.  My approach is grounded in Rational Emotive Behavioural Theory wich seeks to identify and eliminate irrational beliefs that may cause maladaptive behavior.  I also integrate EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) into my practice along with an array of other eclectic theories.  

I hold a Master's degree in Community Counseling from the University of Northern Colorado.  I am a Certified Addictions Counselor level three, and EMDR trained, level two.
